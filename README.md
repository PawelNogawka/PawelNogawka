<h3 align="left">About my Learning and Projects:</h3>
<p align="left"> 
I learned everything by myself, mainly from Udemy courses, but also from programming articles and other resources.
</p>
<p align="left">
After learning the basics of CSs and Javascript, I decided to create simple websites to train my skills.
I first designed each page I created in the figma application
On each page, I tried to put various components to learn something new in the field of CSS and JavaScript each time. These are various sliders, animations, cards, 3d effects, accordions, business cards, API and much more.
One of the pages that I created is available on the Internet at the address:
<a href="https://kongrod.pl/"> https://kongrod.pl/ </a>
<br>
The components that I used on these websites come from the following courses:
<br>
 <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/50-web-projects-with-html-css-and-javascript/">50+ Web Projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>
<br>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/"> 50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript </a>
</p>
<p align="left">
After completing dozens of small JavaScript projects from the course:
<br>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-course-projects/"> Complete JavaScript Projects Course Games 55 Modern JS DOM </a>
<br>
I started making games that I did with an instructor first, and then I made the games myself from scratch. In games, I didn't focus on CSS, I only focused on JavaScript
</p>
<p align="left">
I would still like to learn CSS and JavaScript by creating games, applications and websites, but I would like to constantly increase the level of difficulty to learn more and more. In the future I would like to learn React and Node.js.
